Pre-presentation
=================
1. Presentation: (suggestion-Rui)
  - Must meet requirements from prof (find out what they are)
  - Make it look nice!

1. Test cases: (suggestion-Fanxing)
  - As many interesting Gtk tests as possible (Fanxing and Rui)
  - Fixing testall.sh (Risto)
  - Fixing other tests cases (Whoever gets to it first)

2. Adding remaining syntax: (-Risto)
  - Adding 'tell' command as a function call: tell("program", "command")
  - Adding gets, which must be either recognize just strings, or explicitly
    any type:
    - If any type, then dynInt, dynString, and dynChar will be defined so
      that:
      - Binop doesn't evaluate the expression but instead pretty prints the line
    - If just string, then the dynamic types aren't necessary
  - Adding lists, which would have a way to be called (like args[i]), stored
    and read.


Post-presentation
==================

1. Final report:
  - Must meet requirements from prof (find out what they are)

2. Update LRM:
  - Explain how the Pear plugin works a little better.
  - Improve and standardize the notation throughout the doc (the plugin's is not
    like the language's notation).
  - Update the syntax to what it has become (our current language specs)
